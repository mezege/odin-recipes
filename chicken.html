        <h2>Top tips for making chicken burgers.</h2>

        <p>- How long do I cook them? The trick to cooking a good chicken burger is watching the cook time These burgers can go from juicy to bone dry quickly once overcooked.  They should take about 4 to 5 minutes per side, but to ensure doneness, use an instant-read meat thermometer: check that the center of the burger reaches 165ºF, which is the USDA's recommended temperature for poultry.</p>
        <p>- do I keep my chicken burgers from falling apart? Your patties should come together and hold together nicely while cooking, but we do suggest being careful with them while cooking. Don’t mess with them too much while they’re in the pan, and take care when flipping!</p>
        <p>- How should I top them? We load these burgers up with crunchy, bright coleslaw before topping with creamy avocado slices, spicy fresh red onion, and cheddar and jalapeño before sandwiching all of it between buttery brioche buns for the ultimate bite. </p>
