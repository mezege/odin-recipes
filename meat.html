    <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties: </p>

    <p>Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor. </p>
